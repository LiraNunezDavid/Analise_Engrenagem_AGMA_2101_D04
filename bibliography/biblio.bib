Therefore, a new analytical model based on the mechanics theory with an accurate profile equation is established to calculate the maximum TRS and corresponding CSL quickly and accurately by solving the extreme value.

  abstractnote = {Carburized gears are commonly used in heavy-duty machines such as wind turbines, ships and high-speed rails. The gradient characteristics of mechanical properties and microstructure from the case to the core and the complex subsurface stress state in service make it very challenging to understand the contact fatigue performance of the carburized gears. In this study, a numerical model considering the effects of mechanical properties and microstructure gradients is developed to investigate the contact fatigue damage behavior of a wind turbine carburized gear. The hardness gradient in the case depth is modelled using Thomas empirical equation. The microstructure gradient is considered in terms of the grain size variation adopting the technique of Voronoi tessellation. The damage-coupled elastic-plastic material constitutive relations are developed to capture the intergranular mechanical response and the progressive fatigue damage under repeated gear meshing. The results indicate that the shear stress reversal is not uniformly distributed along the grain boundaries of the same depth. The critical subsurface depth of crack initiation and the fatigue damage evolution obtained from the calculation model compare well to the experimental and numerical results readily available in literature. With the developed framework, the influences of normal load and case carburization on the fatigue damage behavior of the carburized gear are also investigated and discussed in detail.},

However, since the tip-relieved gear profile has not been accurately approximated with a quadratic parabola, the TSCS cannot be calculated using the cylindrical contact model of the Hertzian contact theory (Hertz model). Therefore, a new more accurate analytical model for calculating the non-Hertzian TSCS of tip-relieved gears is proposed in this paper. This model is established based on the accurate tooth profile equations represented by the parameter equations (new model). The solution of the model with an implicit function and a singular integral is also studied. Finally, the TSCS of two gear pairs with and without tip relief are compared for different parameters under different loads according to the new model, the finite element method (FEM model) and Hertz model. The results show that the tip relief will affect the maximum TSCS, location and size of the contact area, whereas the Hertz model cannot quantify these effects. However, the new model, which is validated using the FEM model, can provide accurate and reliable results.},

The current dynamic FEM and static FEM also have some disadvantages may cause the analysis of time-vary load capacity difficult.

  abstractnote = {Spur gears are widely used in the power transmission mechanism of several machines. Due to the transmitted torque, spur gears experience high stresses which could cause gear tooth failure by surface pitting or root fracture. Tip relief and other gear profile modification have been considered for reducing the induced stresses in the gear tooth. In this work, the influence of tip relief on stresses on a pair of identical spur gear was analyzed using commercial FEA software ANSYS, and formulae for estimating contact and bending stresses were derived. Three cases of gear sets were analyzed; a non-modified pair and another two sets with linear and parabolic tip relief profiles. The non-modified gear set frictionless contact stress was validated against the calculated AGMA pitting resistance, Hertzian contact stress and a reported contact stress value in the literature. The four methods agreed well with each other. Similarly, bending stress was also compared with the AGMA bending strength and Lewis bending stress for validation. Then, friction coefficient was varied from 0.0 to 0.3 with increment of 0.1. The gear contact stress increased up to 11% relative to the frictionless case, whereas bending stress decreased by 6%. Linear tip relief modification was carried out for increasing normalised tip relief values of 0.25 to 1.0 with increment of 0.25. The gear frictionless contact and bending stresses decreased by a maximum of 4% and 2%, respectively. Frictional contact stress increased by up to 7.1% and the bending stress is almost identical with the frictionless case. Parabolic tip relief was also carried out with similar normalised tip relief values. Frictionless contact stress decreased by 5% while frictional contact stress increased by up to 11.5% and the bending stress is also almost identical with the frictionless case. Finally, four formulae were introduced for estimating the contact and bending stresses for a tip modified spur gear.},

The comparison of proofed old rating methods (HENRIOT….) with ISO 6336 has shown that ISO is very conservative for through hardened steels gear wheels running with case hardened pinion specifically in the range of limited life. This has emphasis the need to develop experimental tests, in representative conditions.

The variation of the contact stress during rotation is compared with the contact stress at the lowest point of single-tooth contact (LPSTC) and the AGMA (American Gear Manufacturers Association) equation for the contact stress.

But the most important gear design outputs that are module (m) and face width (b) are obtained from both of the approaches always differ from each other even under the same input parameters. Therefore, gear designers require detailed knowledge on the relative comparison of design outputs including cost. And a translation technique using conversion factors in between the standards are demanded as a stated need in the literature. Hence, this paper firstly obtains dimensionless gear rating numbers (GRi) to rate the design results of spur gears determined from both ISO 6336 and ANSI/AGMA 2101-D04 Standards, and then derives correlation equations to generate dimensionless conversion factors (CFs) to convert the design results obtained from ISO to AGMA. The CFs allow designers to move from one standard to another very easily. This enables engineering students and designers to meet the ever changing needs of global market.},
