<h1 data-label="conclusuxe3o" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusão </h1><div>Neste trabalho foi realizado o estado da arte do cálculo à fadiga em
engrenagens cilíndricas, destacando 4 formas na literatura cientifica:
i) testes experimentais, mas, um dos pontos negativos é o custo para
fabricar protótipos físicos para ensaios, além de que os mesmos têm que
ser reproduzidos numa escala bem maior ao elemento real para minimizar
os erros no posicionamento de sensores e coleta de dados; ii) análise
computacional, principalmente destacam-se o ANSYS e ABAQUS, mas os
mesmos apresentam pontos negativos em relação a custos com processadores
computacionais para obter resultados preciso e rápidos, custo para
aquisição do software, além disso, embora tenham ocorrido muitas
melhorias nas suas versões para a modelagem 3D de um elemento, ainda não
são tão amigáveis quando comparado a outros programas específicos de
CAD, tais como o Solid Edge; iii) modelagem analítica usando a norma ISO
6336, mas, um dos pontos negativos é que dita norma considera apenas a
carga tangencial nos seus cálculos, fato que obriga à mesma ser
conservadora nos seus resultados, outro inconveniente é não estar
difundida no mundo acadêmico a sua nova versão de 2019, além de
apresentar um custo relativamente alto para sua aquisição; iv) modelagem
analítica usando a norma AGMA 2101 para sistema internacional,
apresenta-se como a mais rápida e fácil de ser usada para cálculos à
fadiga de tensão à flexão e contato, além de ser mais divulgada nas
pesquisas científicas, considerar nos seus cálculos as cargas tangencial
e radial, ter possibilidade de aquisição da mesma a um valor bem baixo
para fins acadêmicos, e mesmo se adquirida comercialmente a mesma é 60%
mais barata que a norma ISO. Um ponto negativo da norma AGMA é que não
considera nos seus cálculos um fator para avaliar o impacto do alivio no
adendo da ponta do dente de uma engrenagem.</div><div>                                  Destaca-se também neste  trabalho que a aparição de uma possível fratura ao contato apresenta-se depois  de 10<sup>7</sup> ciclos a mais de 1 mm de profundidade em relação à superfície  do flanco do dente de engrenagem, considerando que a engrenagem possui algum  tipo de tratamento térmico na sua superfície. Outro dado importante que pode  minimizar o tempo de processamento para uma FEA é a confirmação de que  analisando apenas a geometria de 3 dentes de uma engrenagem, independentemente  do número total de dentes, apresenta resultados confiáveis. Também, o estado da  arte aponta que um alivio no adendo da ponta do dente de uma engrenagem, (acima  do diâmetro primitivo), proporciona um engrenamento mais leve e diminui a  tensão de contato com o dedendo, (abaixo do diâmetro primitivo), do dente que engrena,  mas, se esse alivio não for calculado pode influenciar negativamente no aumento  da tensão à flexão. Além disso, normalmente na literatura acadêmica  considera-se que o cordão raiz é o produto do módulo vezes constante de 0,3 ou 0,35,  já nos estudos recentes são usados para o cordão raiz, a multiplicação do módulo  pela constante 0,38, dessa forma há maior dissipação da tensão no filete do  dente        .</div><div>Outro aporte deste trabalho é o detalhamento da norma AGMA 2101-D04 e a
inclusão de tabelas e gráficos da literatura cientifica, proporcionando
assim, um protocolo para seu uso e modelagem analítica de qualquer tipo
de engrenagem cilíndrica de dentes retos. Além disso é disponibilizada
uma planilha com todos os equacionamentos, fácil de ser descarregada.
Isto possibilitará que em futuros trabalhos possa ser desenvolvido dito
equacionamento em códigos de linguagem de programação como o Python,
fortalecendo uma das vulnerabilidades que possui o uso de uma planilha
Excel, por exemplo.</div><div>No item concepção e desenvolvimento deste trabalho, foram usados dados
reais de um equipamento conhecido pelo autor. Foi modelada a forma
analítica da engrenagem usando a norma AGMA 2101-D04 (2016) e
comparou-se com resultados obtidos no software Solid Edge que na sua
biblioteca indica usar a norma ISO 6336. Comprovou-se que há divergência
nos resultados obtidos e de uma forma geral os resultados do Solid Edge
são mais conservadores que a norma AGMA, mesmo cenário relatado no
estado da arte quando comparadas as normas AGMA e ISO.</div><div>Finalmente, pretende-se em futuros trabalhos automatizar a norma AGMA
2101-D04 criando códigos de programação no Python. Além disso,
pretende-se convidar outros pesquisadores para analisar os dados deste
trabalho no ANSYS.</div><div>Referências Bibliográficas</div><div>@article{AGMA 2101-D04_2016, place={Virginia}, title={ANSI/AGMA

ISO and AGMA Standards are the most commonly used accurate approaches
while designing a gear. But the most important gear design outputs that
are module (m) and face width (b) are obtained from both of the
approaches always differ from each other even under the same input
parameters. Therefore, gear designers require detailed knowledge on the
relative comparison of design outputs including cost. And a translation
technique using conversion factors in between the standards are demanded
as a stated need in the literature. Hence, this paper firstly obtains
dimensionless gear rating numbers (GRi) to rate the design results of
spur gears determined from both ISO 6336 and ANSI/AGMA 2101-D04
Standards, and then derives correlation equations to generate
dimensionless conversion factors (CFs) to convert the design results
obtained from ISO to AGMA. The CFs allow designers to move from one
standard to another very easily. This enables engineering students and
designers to meet the ever changing needs of global market.}, note={1

DOI={10.1007/s11771-019-4180-x}, abstractNote={Spur gears are widely
used in the power transmission mechanism of several machines. Due to the
transmitted torque, spur gears experience high stresses which could
cause gear tooth failure by surface pitting or root fracture. Tip relief
and other gear profile modification have been considered for reducing
the induced stresses in the gear tooth. In this work, the influence of
tip relief on stresses on a pair of identical spur gear was analyzed
using commercial FEA software ANSYS, and formulae for estimating contact
and bending stresses were derived. Three cases of gear sets were
analyzed; a non-modified pair and another two sets with linear and
parabolic tip relief profiles. The non-modified gear set frictionless
contact stress was validated against the calculated AGMA pitting
resistance, Hertzian contact stress and a reported contact stress value
in the literature. The four methods agreed well with each other.
Similarly, bending stress was also compared with the AGMA bending
strength and Lewis bending stress for validation. Then, friction
coefficient was varied from 0.0 to 0.3 with increment of 0.1. The gear
contact stress increased up to 11% relative to the frictionless case,
whereas bending stress decreased by 6%. Linear tip relief modification
was carried out for increasing normalised tip relief values of 0.25 to
1.0 with increment of 0.25. The gear frictionless contact and bending
stresses decreased by a maximum of 4% and 2%, respectively. Frictional
contact stress increased by up to 7.1% and the bending stress is almost
identical with the frictionless case. Parabolic tip relief was also
carried out with similar normalised tip relief values. Frictionless
contact stress decreased by 5% while frictional contact stress
increased by up to 11.5% and the bending stress is also almost
identical with the frictionless case. Finally, four formulae were
introduced for estimating the contact and bending stresses for a tip
modified spur gear.}, note={Nenhuma citaçãoPeriódico com:SNIP 0,71SJR

Health Management (PHM) have been introduced into mechanical items of
manufacturing systems to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL). PHM as an
estimate of the RUL allows Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) before a
functional failure occurs, avoiding corrective maintenance that
generates unnecessary costs on production lines. An important factor for
the implementation of PHM is the correct data collection for monitoring
a machine’s health, in order to evaluate its reliability. Data
collection, besides providing information about the state of degradation
of the machine, also assists in the analysis of failures for intelligent
interventions. Thus, the present work proposes the construction of an
ontological model for future applications such as expert system in the
support in the correct decision-making, besides assisting in the
implementation of the PHM in several manufacturing scenarios, to be used
in the future by web semantics tools focused on intelligent
manufacturing, standardizing its concepts, terms, and the form of

The model construction is achieved using the ontology development 101

this study, a numerical model considering the effects of mechanical

contact fatigue damage behavior of a wind turbine carburized gear. The
hardness gradient in the case depth is modelled using Thomas empirical
equation. The microstructure gradient is considered in terms of the
grain size variation adopting the technique of Voronoi tessellation. The
damage-coupled elastic-plastic material constitutive relations are
developed to capture the intergranular mechanical response and the
progressive fatigue damage under repeated gear meshing. The results
indicate that the shear stress reversal is not uniformly distributed
along the grain boundaries of the same depth. The critical subsurface
depth of crack initiation and the fatigue damage evolution obtained from
the calculation model compare well to the experimental and numerical
results readily available in literature. With the developed framework,
the influences of normal load and case carburization on the fatigue

using the cylindrical contact model of the Hertzian contact theory

calculating the non-Hertzian TSCS of tip-relieved gears is proposed in
